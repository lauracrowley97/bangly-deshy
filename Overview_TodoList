Okay so just creating an overview of scripts we have/scripts we need to do by Wednesday..also might form part of the report as a general explanation of our approac

First we clean the Road data from .lrps.htm files (original from Bangly-deshy ministry) with a python script (NAME??)
    1. First htm need to be imported with pandas: takes a list of the roadnames to iterate through every .lrps file and convert
    2. Takes one road at a time and looks for outliers of lrp points.
    3. Outliers that are of type 'bridge' are interpolated.
    4. all other outliers are (TO BE DECIDED...if no time we just delete these)
    5. Chainage is checke: TO BE DONE (compare distance between two points and the difference in their chainage..some threshold value is needed, that is different for th Type of road)
    6. output files: file of all changed/deleted lrp points.
          ...also output a csv for each road with column names (road name,lrp number, lat, lon, chainage, updated (y/n))...containing all lrp points and whethere they were changed

An initial visual scan of the generated co-ordinates should be completed at this point.

Next script is an R script to clean the bridge data
    1. Uses the .csv output from the roads, and the BMMS_overview.csv initially.
    2. Iterates through each bridge point and compares it to the lrp in the road data to see if anything related to it has changed
    3. If so, the corresponding bridge point needs regenerating
    4. There are 4 ways of converting bridge point location from the road data
    5. output files: file of all changed/deleted bridge lrp points
              ...... also a the output csv of the BMMS_overview with corrected data
    


Another R script generats the .tcv of the roads, that is required for simulation
    1. this is adapted to the required format form the .csv file generated in the first python
    2. Pretty straight forward - see brightspace: 
          "infrastructure/_roads.tcv: a tab-separated text-file with processed information from the
          RMMS dataset. It contains a first line with explanation, and the following tab-separated data
          starting from line 2, with one road per line. 

              o road name: the official name of the road
              o lrp1: the name of the first LRP of the road
              o lat1: the latitude of lrp1
              o lon1: the longitude of lrp1
              o ...
              o lrpn: the name of the last LRP of the road
              o latn: the latitude of lrpn
              o lonn: the longitude of lrpn"
