Step by step walk through:

A data-prep
1. Follow the data preparation steps described in the report
2. Run all lines inside jupyter notebook Data-Preparation part 1.ipynb
3. Take data_traffic_road_segments as input of part 2 and use other input data in the folder --> (it is already in part 2, can be run seperately)
4. Run all lines inside jupyter notebook Data-Preparation part 2.ipynb

B visualisation:
We use plotly as a tool to visualise, every useraccount provided with the username and api has a limited amount of plots per 24hours
So be carefull with running to much visualisations at once (you can do 25 per account and we used several account --> which should be more than enough)
The account details are allready provided in the scripts and should work. 

1. Run lines in visualisation part 3.1 and use all provided input data in that same folder 
2. You can look at the interactive plotly charts in the jupyter notebook and in the HTML files
3. Run lines in visualisation part 3.2.1 and use all provided input data in that same folder
4. Again the interactive plotly charts can be used only inside the jupyter notebook file 
5. Run lines in visualisation part 3.2.2 and use all provided input data in that same folder
6. Again the interactive plotly charts can be used only inside the jupyter notebook file
